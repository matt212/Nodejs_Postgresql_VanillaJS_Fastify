**Custom fractural pattern based app** :

> things which are plug and play

- new fields (datatypes string and ints ) ,
  config based modular apporach on server side `duh`.
- validation is sly-ly implemented taken care by config based modular apporach on client side.
- <u> `modulerized everything baby` </u> concept for excel export ,import table rendering and dynamic pivot based filters !
- create, update , delete. search is implemented for single table and complex queries multi join alias based approach queries.
- every thing search, group by multiselect search is paginated to the core for effeciency and scalabliltiy.which goes without sayin is modulerized to the core .
- single set depenendences routes wherein all dependencies are imported from dependencies core.
  > **_The essence is request and response structure which in turn is based on fractural pattern which is fuel for this custom ad -hoc

> oOh, I forgot stream based realtime **_1000k_** yup you read that right **_1000k_** with bare minimum hardware pick any lowest minimum droplet (digitalocean), aws instance for more or less $5 a months and this ground up platform works seamlessly due to fine tune architecture over period of time
