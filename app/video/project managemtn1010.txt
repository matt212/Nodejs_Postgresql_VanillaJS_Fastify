analyse stakeholder 

project solution 
gathering requirement
identifiying deliverables
defining scope
plan
work how much time
how many resources
using above we can build schedule
process
(communcation, managing changes)

how will know when your done 
what determines as sign off 
which has spelled out clearly with 
stakeholder responsibilites in place
what goes into project plan building and fine tuning a project schedule



simple put project delveriables are the results that a project delivers
to determine whether deliverablesis  
what they are supposed to be we need some way to measure it 
those measurement is called success criteria
deliverable can be tangile like new building , new product or new service	

deliverable basically help us define project scope
is basically is what is and isnta in a project 
deliveravle help to measure progress while your project is underway

1.to document project deliverable we should start at end deliverables
what is supposed to be migration , buidling schideling system
2. sign a contract with (SOW)
3. Define deliverables that can be accompoblised in timeframe of status reports
that way you can evaluate progress from last status report based upon deliverable compeleted from last report
now that you have identified you deliverable lets measure success
"suceess criteria"
you need quatifiable criteria you can measure them with 


identify end deliverables

identiy intemrediate delverales
define clear and quantifiable success criteria
 

--------------Assumption and risks
1. use to fill information 
2. revisist and modify as necessary
for example how much customization is needed
3. in order to avoid disaaptioned assumption should be brought into open and clarified and middle path has to adopted 
make sure everyone is on same page 	 
4. ask about project expectations

Risk 
a situation or event that might occur
what defines as risk is that it is uncertain
flag and convey the risj to required stakeholder for both teams
case in point vendor /client
assumption and risk are manageable as long you identify them upfront 

--what is project scope
projec scope is culimantion of your defination works
it secribes he boundaries of project  
get project scope in writing
helps scope creep
scope creep is for eg:one you do this one thing we forgot to add to project delvertiables
change management process comes into effect
reminf stakeholder what is agreed upon 
and change management 
scope emcompasssed below
goals and objectives
asummptions
risk
deliverabes

meeting schedule and budget while working around the problem that arieses
